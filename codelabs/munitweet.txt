b'@jamisonsf @SF311 @sfmta_muni This goes way back Jamison. Perhaps you recall 1996 when Muni had the audacity to try installing platforms on Church Street.

b"Meanwhile... @sfmta_muni does have the most beautiful heritage streetcar fleet in the world.

b'@BayAreaGooners @sfmta_muni I travel on this route frequently and it is FREQUENTLY one of the worst in the city!  Drivers not turning up and buses taken out of service (missing) are the bane of any #27 bus rider\xe2\x80\x99s day.  IB or OB. \xf0\x9f\x91\xbf\xf0\x9f\x98\xa2'

b"@SF311 @marijuanadotorg 10/11 It's not like there are things the City can do ^BC, this is a spot @SFMTA_Muni wouldn't install a loading zone in front of a UPS store.\n\nShocker: without a place to pull over, UPS and other delivery trucks park directly in the bike lane. https://t.co/5izpgeuhPz"
